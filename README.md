### Problems:
1. The objective of the first part of the problem statement is to predict the Stock Price of a
Listed Stock on 10th August 2020. The output file 01 should contain only Stock Index and
the respective Stock Price for the test data.

2. The Put-Call Ratio of a stock is a time-dependent parameter, for which you have to come up
with a Time-series prediction model. Using the Put-Call Ratio predicted by the model, you
need to calculate the Stock Price on 16th Aug 2020 for every Stock in the test data. . The
output file 02 should contain only Stock Index and the respective Stock Price on 16th August.
